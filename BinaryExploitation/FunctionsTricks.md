## scanf:

when used you can pass "." , this will not overwrite the data where the input will be saved, you can use this to bypass stack canarys for example.

---

convert float numbers to address and vice versa:
use `struct.unpack('>d', binascii.unhexlify("00007f2732081184"))[0]` to convert addresses to float numbers.

## getline:

if you can control the lineptr then you can write to other places.

---

## execveat:

The function prototype of execveat is

```
int execveat(int dirfd, const char *pathname,
                    char *const argv[],
                    char *const envp[],
                    int flags);
```

and it is same as execve, except that execveat has one more argument dirfd as the first argument (but this is not used when pathname is a fullpath).
So, the register we need to control is not rdi but rsi, which is controllable!

# Shared /proc

If the proc fs is shared then you can enter to another process namespace using nsenter
```bash
nsenter --target PID --all -- /bin/bash
```

if proc is not mounted u can mount it with
```bash
mount -t proc proc /proc
```

# Host file descreptor

if u have an fd from the host u can use fchdir to escape.

## nosuid

If u want to use setuid trick then check first if file system has nosuid set.
```bash
mount | grep nosuid
```

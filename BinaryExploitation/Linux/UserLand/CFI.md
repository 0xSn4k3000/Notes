## Control-Flow Integrity
Prevent attacker from redirecting the flow of execution by checking the call address with saved address from the compile time.

It compares both addresses, if they are equal it then jumps to the right address and calls the function stored at the address described by the pointer. Otherwise itâ€™ll execute an undefined instruction (ud2) which will cause the program to abort


Enable cfi in program with clang
```bash
clang -o password password.c -flto -fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=default
```

## Arbitary Write:

You can use FileStructure.read(ADDRESS, LEN) to write to anywhere in the memory. You can use the builtin stdin too.

## Arbitary Read:

You can use FileStructure.write(ADDRESS, LEN) to read from anywhere in the memroy, You can use the builtin stdout too.

Notes:
1. Remember to add a pad to change the FILE.fileno too.
2. Remember to make the LEN greater than the len in the function called so that the FILE been used.
e.g
```
__isoc99_scanf@plt (
   $rdi = 0x00000000004025f4 → 0x756f590073343625 ("%64s"?),
   $rsi = 0x00000000006502a0 → 0x0000000000000000,
   $rdx = 0x0000000000000080, -> here you have to make your len greater than 0x80 (not real but for demo case).
   $rcx = 0x00007f34895d4b00 → 0x5877fffff0003d48 ("H="?)
)
```

## Exploiting the vtable:

Notes:
1. Set the _lock to a writable location with value NULL.

Steps:
1. Set file.wide_data->vtable to point to exploit_vtable.
2. Overwrite file.vtable such that IO_wfile_overflow gets called.
3. Which calls do_allocbuf.
4. Which calls into wide_data vtable with no check.

## Leak a stack address using libc leak


There is a symbol `environ` in libc, whose value is the same as the third arg of main function, `char **envp`. The value of char **envp is on the stack, thus we can leak stack address with this symbol. 

Leak LIBC_BASE + environ_offset


## Using STDOUT as a read primitive. (libc 2.38 and lower)

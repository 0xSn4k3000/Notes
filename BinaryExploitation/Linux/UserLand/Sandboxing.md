## seccomp:

**INFO**
1. seccomp cannot check the memory , it's only check addresses.

---

## Tricks:

If the shellcode area registers are cleared before passing control to you always check the SIMD registers (XMM\*, YMM\*);

### Seccomp with bpf

1. BPF_LD: This instruction loads a value from memory into a register. It can load values from different parts of the BPF context, such as system call number, arguments, or other data.    

2. BPF_ALU: This instruction performs arithmetic or logical operations on registers. It includes operations like addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR/XOR, and shifts.

3. BPF_JMP: This instruction allows conditional jumps based on the values in registers. It includes jump instructions like BPF_JEQ (jump if equal), BPF_JNE (jump if not equal), BPF_JGT (jump if greater than), and so on. The jump destinations are specified as offsets relative to the current instruction.

4. BPF_RET: This instruction terminates the BPF program and returns a value. It can be used to allow or deny a system call based on certain conditions.

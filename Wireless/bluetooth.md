# Attack types

| Attack | Dis  |
|--------|------|
| Bluesnarfing | A cyber-attack involving unauthorised access to information from wireless devices through Bluetooth. |
| Bluejacking | An attack that sends unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. |
| BlueSmacking | A Denial-of-Service attack that overwhelms a device's Bluetooth connection. |
| Bluebugging | A technique used to gain control over a device via Bluetooth. |
| BlueBorne | A set of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to take control of devices, spread malware, or perform other malicious activities via Bluetooth. | 
| KNOB (Key Negotiation of Bluetooth) | An attack that manipulates the data encryption process during Bluetooth connection establishment, weakening security. | 
| BIAS (Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS) | This attack exploits a vulnerability in the pairing process, allowing an attacker to impersonate a trusted device. |

## Cryptanalysis Side-Channel Attacks

Cryptanalysis side-channel attacks are an intriguing topic in cybersecurity. These attacks utilise information gained from implementing and running a computer system rather than brute force or theoretical weaknesses in algorithms.

### Side-channel attacks
### Timing Attacks
These exploit the correlation between the computation time of cryptographic algorithms and the secrets they process.

### Power-Monitoring Attacks
These monitor the power consumption of a device to determine what data it is processing.
